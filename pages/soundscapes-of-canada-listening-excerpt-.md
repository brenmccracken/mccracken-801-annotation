  <p><b>Critical Audiotext Annotation: R. Murray Schafer’s <em>Soundscapes of Canada</em></b></p>
  <p>Prepared by Brennan McCracken for ENGL 801 - Sonic Approaches in Literary Studies</p>
<p>Near the beginning of a 1994 essay titled “Radical Radio,” the composer and acoustic ecologist R. Murray Schafer describes a thought experiment he used in the classroom as a professor of communications at Simon Fraser University: </p>
<p><em>Consider yourself a visitor from another planet; your spaceship allows you to cruise close enough to pick up twenty-four hours of North American radio; report back to me everything you learn about North Americans.</em> (208)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the essay, Schafer frames the exercise as one that reveals the debasement of radio in late-20th century North America, a medium whose potential for the circulation of art and the development of collective identities had been stifled by commercial enterprise. He laments the banalities that the alien visitors in his experiment might report from their listening: “their favourite colour is extra-white”; “their favourite game is trying to predict the weather” (208). He later contrasts the commercial dilution of radio with a more radical possibility: if “radio [were to become] an art form,” he speculates,” its content would be totally transformed”; rather than “[spinning] as the slave to machine technology” or recording the “spasms of production and consumption,” Schafer imagines a “radical” radio which might allow the “phenomena of the world” to “speak for themselves” (214). Schafer’s writing carries a powerful affective force and a desirous relationship to the possibility of a world that sounds otherwise. In “Radical Radio,” I read commitments to sound as a medium for art, as a tool for the (re)production of truth claims and cultural identity, and as a cipher for greater attunement between humans and their environments.</p>
<p>	This layered valence of Schafer’s thinking about radio offers a helpful way of framing the critical motivations and sonic outcomes of one of his own experiments with producing sound for broadcast: the <em>Soundscapes of Canada</em> project, a 10-part series that aired on CBC Radio 1’s documentary program <em>Ideas</em> in October 1974. This series is significant in Schafer’s oeuvre, primarily for its use of public radio broadcasting to engage a broader listening public beyond the university or the world of contemporary music. The series also attempts to execute the possibilities that Schafer elucidates in “Radical Radio”: that is, it situates radio waves as a site for avant-garde creative expression outside of commercial demands, while also attempting to forge (or shore up) a sense of national identity through sound. As Mitchell Akiyama suggests, this project thus demands a critical retrospective attention: Akiyama argues that <em>Soundscapes of Canada</em> episodes such as “Signals and Keynotes,” which collages “soundmarks” (sound + landmark) recorded on a road trip across Canada, demonstrate a “troubling politics of self-recognition in action” for a rapidly-urbanizing nation that had recently committed to federal multiculturalism (“Unsettling”). Here, I have excerpted the first five minutes from episode two of the series to elucidate the specific audile technique Schafer seeks to develop in the listening public. In this episode, Schafer engages the audience directly in listening exercises to attune them to the practices, conditions, and technologies that shape their own listening. I suggest that this excerpt, due to its narration by Schafer and its interpolation of the listener, provides an accessible and useful point of departure for the critical study of <em>Soundscapes of Canada</em>.
<p>The annotations that accompany the excerpted audio provide introductory and contextual information for the series; offer reflections on Schafer’s thinking about sound and “soundscapes”; and cite criticism and opportunities for further reading/listening. There is an additional annotation layer that provides a transcription of Schafer’s speech in this excerpt. You may click on the "Layer" heading to toggle between these annotation layers.</p>
