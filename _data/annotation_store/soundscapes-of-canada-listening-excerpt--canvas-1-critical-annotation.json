The series was produced by R. Murray Schafer and other members of the World Soundscape Project (WSP), many of whom were students of Schafer’s at Simon Fraser University. The series was acquired by the Library of the Canadian Music Centre (CMC) in October 1998; all 10 episodes are available to listen to via the CMC website. ",

        "value": "This episode is unique in the Soundscapes of Canada series for its narration by Schafer and its explicit engagement with the listening public. Many of the other episodes feature collages and compositions of found sound, drawn primarily from recordings made by WSP members Bruce Davis and Peter Huse on a cross-Canada road trip in October 1973 (what Mitchell Akiyama calls the “backbone” of the project) (“Unsettling”). Here, in the first half of episode 2 of the series, the only recorded sound that is present is that of Schafer’s voice. At the beginning of the episode, Schafer invites listeners to join him in a “listening experiment”; this “experiment” represents a sort of audile training to prepare listeners to properly listen to the soundscape compositions to follow in subsequent episodes. Jonathan Sterne uses the term audile technique to denote “a concrete set of limited and related practices of listening and practical orientations toward listening” (Audible Past 90). The opening of this episode of Soundscapes of Canada explicitly involves listeners in an awareness of their practices of listening, thus developing or refining in listeners a particular audile technique of “intensive” listening through “undivided attention.”",

        "value": "The audile technique that Schafer outlines for listeners accompanies a demand for a specific set of listening conditions—conditions that ostensibly seek to minimize distractions in the listening environment, but which also uphold the “desire for aesthetic purity” that animates much of Schafer’s critical work (Sterne “Soundscape” 190). Akiyama identifies the goal of Soundscapes of Canada as twofold: as simultaneously “[opening] the ears of Canadian listeners to the importance of sonic experience, and [alerting] them to … the degradation of the soundscape thanks to the mounting din of industrial modernity” (“Unsettling”). We might think of this episode as a training specifically in Schafer’s concept of the “soundscape”—a neologism that he is credited with popularizing that denotes, ostensibly, “any acoustic field of study,” but which also connotes a conservative advocacy for a return to a quieter, pre-modern relationship to sound (Sterne “Soundscape” 181). Many sound studies scholars have offered genealogies, extensions, and criticisms of the term “soundscape” (see Akiyama “Transparent Listening; Samuels el al. “Soundscapes”). Here, in Schafer’s suggestion that “it’s simply got to be relatively quiet where you are or nothing at all will work,” I hear a trace of what Jonathan Sterne identifies as the “fairly strict—if sophisticated—antimodernist politics” of Schafer’s “soundscape” (“Soundscape” 183). Schafer invites listeners to engage with his “experiment” provided that they can achieve a degree of aesthetic purity in their own soundscapes. One can imagine that many listeners—listeners living in noisy urban environments; listeners with young children; listeners with difficulty hearing—may not feel hailed by this invitation. From the very beginning of the series, then, Schafer’s purism generates an exclusionary posture (a posture which is upheld, following Akiyama’s lucid criticism of the aural whiteness and “pioneering” method of Soundscapes of Canada, in the project’s source material). See Akiyama’s “Unsettling the World Soundscape Project” for further attention to “what [the project] leaves out.” ",

He introduces the quotation as Jespersen’s, but does not identify the text it comes from, nor does he offer any remarks on why he has chosen it. The text Schafer uses in moments like these—moments where listeners engage in what Pierre Schaeffer calls “reduced” listening, focusing not on the content or meaning of the sound but rather on its traits, such as volume or clarity—is significant. The quotation from Jespersen reminds listeners, if only implicitly, that listening to speech might be reframed as listening to “pleasant” or “strange” sound.",

He stops talking for one minute and asks listeners to pay attention to the dead air that remains—a kind of sound that is colloquially and popularly understood to be verboten in radio broadcast. Reflecting on Soundscapes of Canada in “Radical Radio” two decades later, Schafer writes that the CBC “considered it boring” and speculates that “they had not learned to listen, as we had, with new ears” (251). In the first five minutes of this episode of the project, I suggest, we can thus locate Schafer’s privileging of these “new ears” as evidencing a particular audile technique informed by reduced listening and a desire for aesthetic purity.",
